# Decision-only Observability

## Position

This repository is part of the **Judgment Boundary** work:
a set of experiments and specifications focused on
*when AI systems must stop or not execute*.

See the overarching map:

---

This repository evaluates when to invoke or stop execution as a boundary problem, not as a performance competition.

---

## Scope
This repository defines judgment boundaries that prevent execution without an explicit judgment step.
It does not own, automate, or enforce judgment authority and makes no legal or compliance claims.

## Non-Goals
- No judgment automation or ownership
- No legal-grade or court-ready claims
- No sealed or proprietary authority
- No safety or compliance guarantees

Notes on observing decision-only (non-executed) operations using existing OpenTelemetry concepts.

This repository is an informational reference and does not propose new standards or semantic conventions.

This repository intentionally avoids introducing new signals, decision semantics,
or automated enforcement.
